Simplified Treatment Checklist

Saline on sponges – 6mL on each side (12mL per sponge in total).

Insert sponges over white clip forks.

Insert electrodes into each sponge (Red lead > red clip / blue lead > blue clip).

Place cap on head – ensure correct placement of cap as per instructions

Start treatment.

Relax for 30 minutes – follow guidelines.

Guidelines for Treatment

During treatment, you want your brain activity to be ‘neutral’, meaning you want to be relaxed but alert. It is important that you do not participate in any activities that require mental effort as this can prevent the treatment from having long-lasting effects on your memory and thinking abilities.

Acceptable activities

Why?

Sitting / laying down

It doesn’t require mental effort

Light TV/podcast

It doesn’t require mental effort





Activities to avoid

Why?

Drinking coffee/tea before treatment

Coffee stimulates the brain, interfering with the effects of tACS

Reading

It may activate parts of the brain we are targeting.

Using the computer or mobile phone

It may activate parts of the brain we are targeting. 


Talking to people for extensive periods of time

It may activate parts of the brain we are targeting.

Physical activity (e.g. gardening, cleaning)

It may activate different parts of the brain we are targeting and impact hormonal changes.

Sleeping / Meditating

It lowers brain activity to a minimal level which may counteract the stimulation’s effect.

When you have applied the headset as instructed above, using a nearby mirror, ensure the following (Figure 7.4):

The front edge of the cap sits just above your eyebrows. 

Line up the centre of the cap (marked with a black line) to the midpoint between your eye brows.

The cap must cover your ears.

The cap must fit snuggly on your head.

Ensure the electrode leads are facing outward and away from your face.

Begin Treatment



Press the Power button and wait for the RED light to turn on.



Wait for the green ‘start stimulation’ button to begin flashing. This indicates that the device is ready. 
Please note:  You only have 10 seconds to begin stimulation when the green ‘Start Stimulation’ button starts flashing. After this the device powers down and you will need to undertake step 9 again.



Press the green ‘start stimulation’ button to begin stimulation. The button will stop flashing and remain lit for the duration of the treatment.



During Stimulation



Pause stimulation:

If at any time, you need to stop the stimulation, press the yellow ‘Pause stimulation’ button. Stimulation will stop immediately, and the green ‘Start Stimulation’ button will begin to flash. 



Please note: Device will begin to power down automatically if paused for longer than 2 minutes.

Resume stimulation:

To resume stimulation, press the green ‘start stimulation’ button.

The device enables 20 to 40 minutes of treatment per day. If the device is paused, when resumed it will deliver the remaining treatment allowance for that day. 





System error



IF the connection is poor between the electrodes and your scalp: 

The ‘Check headset’ light will light up.



SOLUTIONS: There are three things you can do to improve the 

electrode to scalp connection.

Add another 6ml saline to sides of the sponges that make contact with your scalp (Figure 12.1). 

*Please note on your self-report form if you add more saline. 

*Ensure that the sponges are not too saturated that the saline is leaving the sponge. If this happens you could be connecting electrode to electrode, not electrode to scalp, in which case the treatment is not reaching your brain.



Figure 12.1

Figure 12.1



















Firmly rub the sponges to your scalp

Check that the electrodes and leads are connected properly by pushing the leads into each hole firmly (Figure 12.2).



















Figure 12.2

Figure 12.2



Once you have completed these steps, undertake steps 9-10 again to begin treatment. 

Please note: If the ‘check headset’ lights up again, contact the study coordinator (contact details are provided on the last page of this user-manual)



After Stimulation



Automatic device shut-down:

The device will turn off automatically following the completion of treatment:

The green ‘Start Stimulation’ button will begin to flash.







The yellow ‘Pause Stimulation’ button will flash 3 times rapidly. 

The BrightStim device will then power down (2 minute duration).





Wait until the power button light has turned off before
removing the headset and disconnecting equipment. This is
for safety purposes. If after 2 minutes the device is still on, 

turn the device off at the power button. 



Forced device shut-down:

Please note: ONLY turn device off if it is absolutely necessary

Press the yellow ‘Pause Stimulation’ button and wait for the green ‘Start Stimulation’ button to begin to flash.

Press the yellow ‘Pause Stimulation’ button again and it will flash 3-times rapidly.

The BrightStim device will then power down (2 minute duration).

NB: Wait until the power button light has turned off before removing the headset and disconnecting equipment. This is for safety purposes.

Please note: The device enables up to 60 minutes of treatment per day. If the device turns off after stimulation has been paused, follow steps 9-10 to resume the remaining time allocated for your daily treatment.
